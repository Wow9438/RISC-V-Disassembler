# RISC-V-Disassembler


# Note regarding Compiler:
The input files should also be in same directory as source code.
Compiler used should be able to run C++14 version at least.

# Input:
Place the test case in the same directory as Source code.
Compile the Source code by g++ disassembler.cpp
Execute the compiled code with ./a.out in1.txt out1.txt (respectively).

# Output:
A single output file named out1.txt(based on the argument passed) will be generated.
This output file consists of the disassembled instructions corresponding to the given input assembled c.
